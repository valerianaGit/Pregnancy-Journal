# pregnancy_journal

This flutter project is a 2 screen mobile application. It serves as a journaling/ notes app. where the main screen holds cards with entry dates and one can click on the card to read that post. Also, one can create a new post. 

I used the Provider package for state management as well as intl to format some dates. 
This is a follow up project I created after finishing the Flutter bootcamp to expand on the Flutter world.
